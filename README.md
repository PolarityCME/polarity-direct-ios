# Polarity Direct (iOS)

This repository contains the iOS Swift implementation of **Polarity Direct** —
a working MVP demonstrating a CME-based handshake and bidirectional text
communication between iOS and Android devices.
These scripts demonstrate that meaning can be reduced to a geometric structure, projected
through modular rings, and reconstructed with perfect fidelity across devices.

## Status
- MVP Primitive v3
- Stable handshake
- Bidirectional TEXT confirmed

## Purpose
This project is part of the Polarity / CME research and development effort,
exploring new communication primitives based on structure-first transmission.

⚠️ This is an experimental MVP, not a production messaging app.
